The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.
You have power over your mind â€“ not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.
It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.
He who is brave is free. To be free is to be without fear. Therefore, courage is freedom.
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgments concerning them.
Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things.
No man is free, who is not master of himself.
To be stoic is not to be emotionless, but to remain unmoved by emotions that disturb our peace.
A wise man is indifferent to everything except virtue and vice.
Endure and persist; this pain will pass.
The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.
The only way to deal with fear is to face it.
